From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as greatest common factor (GCF), of two or more
integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For two
integers x, y, the greatest common divisor of x and y is denoted gcd(x,y). For example, the GCD of 8 and 12
is 4, that is, gcd(8, 12) = 4
In the name "greatest common divisor", the adjective "greatest" may be replaced by "highest", and the word
"divisor" may be replaced by "factor", so that other names include highest common factor, etc. Historically,
other names for the same concept have included greatest common measure.
This notion can be extended to polynomials (see Polynomial greatest common divisor) and other commutative
rings

Euclidean algorithm, a variant in which the difference of the two numbers a and b is replaced
by the remainder of the Euclidean division (also called division with remainder) of a by b.
Denoting this remainder as a mod b, the algorithm replaces (a, b) with (b, a mod b) repeatedly
until the pair is (d, 0), where d is the greatest common divisor.
For example, to compute gcd(48,18), the computation is as follows:
	gcd(48,18)	-> gcd(18,48 mod 18) = gcd(18,12)
				-> gcd(12,18 mod 12) = gcd(12,6)
				-> gcd(6,12 mod 6) = gcd(6,0).
This again gives gcd(48, 18) = 6.
